This C program calculates and outputs a letter grade based on a numeric GPA input. It uses arrays and a loop for efficient mapping from GPA to grades, replacing long, repetitive if-else statements.
The program is designed for clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

Features:
Input validation: Ensures GPA is within the valid range (0.0 – 4.0).
Array-based grade mapping: Uses parallel arrays for GPA thresholds and grade labels.
Loop-based logic: Reduces repetition and makes updating grade thresholds easier.
Clear output: Prints the corresponding letter grade to the user.
